# Needfinding
We found two main communities that we could possibly help with a physical technology; our own school community and the local Deaf School.

## _Ting Ting Deaf School_
We started looking for needs by visiting the _Ting Ting Deaf School_ which is a local Chinese school that has students with cochlear implants and special needs.
